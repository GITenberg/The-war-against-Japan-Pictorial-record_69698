<p>This collection of 500-plus pictures dramatically enhances the written
record of World War II in the Pacific Theater. The images freeze in
place the soldiers, the weapons, the operations, the geography, and the
tenor of the moment. Maj. Gen. Orlando Ward’s foreword to the first
edition (<i>see next page</i>) describes this visual dimension as essential to
fully understanding military history. <i>The War Against Japan</i> was one
of the first volumes in the United States Army in World War II series,
and it has stood the test of time. The book has also served as a useful
resource for anyone seeking to illustrate this stage of the war.</p>

<p>Although this second edition keeps all the original photographs,
captions, and short narrative historical introductions in each section,
the Center of Military History has taken several steps to improve the
appearance, currency, and utility of the book. New prints of all existing
photographs ensure their clarity, replacing the old printing negatives
with greatly improved examples. The Center staff also removed
outdated references and developed an appendix that provides more
detailed information on sources and photograph cataloging numbers.
I hope this information will further assist those involved in research
or seeking to obtain their own prints.</p>

<p>In visually documenting the World War II experience, this volume
has proven to be an invaluable collection. By publishing this upgraded
edition, the Center hopes to revive and expand the book’s effectiveness
in promoting an awareness of the determination, courage, and
sacrifices of the American soldier in World War II.</p>

<p>During World War II the photographers of the United States armed
forces created on film a pictorial record of immeasurable value. Thousands
of pictures are preserved in the photographic libraries of the armed
services but are little seen by the public.</p>

<p>In the narrative volumes of UNITED STATES ARMY IN WORLD
WAR II, now being prepared by the Office of the Chief of Military History
of the United States Army, it is possible to include only a limited
number of pictures. Therefore, a subseries of pictorial volumes, of which this
is the last, has been planned to supplement the other volumes of the series.
The photographs have been especially selected to show important terrain
features, types of equipment and weapons, living and weather conditions,
military operations, and matters of human interest. These volumes will
preserve and make accessible for future reference some of the best pictures
of World War II. An appreciation not only of the terrain upon
which actions were fought, but also of its influence on the capabilities
and limitations of weapons in the hands of both our troops and those of
the enemy, can be gained through a careful study of the pictures herein
presented. These factors are essential to a clear understanding of military
history.</p>

<p>The text was written and the photographs compiled by Capt.
Kenneth E. Hunter and Miss Margaret E. Tackley; the volume was edited
by Miss Mary Ann Bacon. The book deals with the Pacific Theater
of Operations and is divided into six sections: (1) The Allied Defensive;
(2) The Strategic Defensive and Tactical Offensive; (3) The Offensive—1944;
(4) The Final Phase; (5) The China-Burma-India Theater;
and (6) The Collapse of Japan and the End of the War in the Pacific.
Each section is arranged in chronological order. All dates used are
local dates, and it should be remembered that all dates west of the
International Date Line are one day ahead of those east of the line.
For example, 7 December 1941 at Pearl Harbor is the same day as 8
December 1941 in the Philippines. The written text has been kept to
a minimum. Each section is preceded by a brief introduction recounting
the major events which are set down in detail in the individual
narrative volumes of UNITED STATES ARMY IN WORLD WAR
II. The appendixes give information as to the abbreviations used and
the sources of the photographs.</p>

<h2>The Allied Defensive<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>Before 7 December 1941, while war was actively being waged in
Europe and the Far East, the United States, still a neutral, was expanding
its manufacturing facilities to meet the demands for additional
war materials, both for the growing U.S. forces and those of the Allies.
On 7 December the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor in an attempt to so
cripple U.S. naval power that future Japanese conquest and occupation
in the Pacific would meet with little or no opposition. This attack dealt
a serious blow to Navy and Army Air Forces units stationed in the Hawaiian
Islands. On the same day two Japanese destroyers attacked the
island of Midway, but were beaten off by the defending troops. On 8
December Wake was assaulted. The attacks on Wake were continued
for two weeks and the small U.S. garrison was forced to surrender on
23 December. Another weak garrison on the island of Guam, unable
to resist the enemy attacks, fell on 10 December.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> See Louis Morton, <i>The Fall of the Philippines</i>, Washington, D.C., 1953, in the series U.S. ARMY IN
WORLD WAR II.</p>

</div>

<p>Early on the morning of 8 December the U.S. forces in the Philippines
were notified that a state of war existed and a full war alert was
ordered. On the same day the first Japanese aerial attack on the Philippines
took place. This was followed by others and on 10 December
enemy landings were made on Luzon. Expecting an early victory, the
Japanese sent a large force, but it was not until 6 May 1942 that the
Japanese were able to conquer the American and Filipino defenders
who fought a delaying action down the Bataan Peninsula and made a
final stand on the island of Corregidor. All military resistance ended
in the rest of the Philippine Islands by 17 May except for small bands
of guerrillas who continued to fight the enemy until 1945 when the
U.S. forces landed in the Philippines. In March 1942 the commander
of the United States Army Forces in the Far East was ordered to move
to Australia by the President of the United States. Troops from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
United States began arriving in Australia in December 1941 for the
build-up in preparation for the defense of Allied bases and the recapture
of enemy-held islands and bases in the Pacific.</p>

<p>While some Japanese forces were carrying out the attacks in the
Pacific, others were overrunning Malaya, North Borneo, and Thailand.
After eighteen days of fighting Hong Kong was captured on 25
December 1941. Thailand, unable to resist the Japanese, agreed to co-operate
with them. Early in 1942 the Japanese took Borneo and by 15
February the British garrison in Malaya capitulated. In the Netherlands
East Indies the U.S. Navy inflicted damage on an enemy convoy
in the Battle of Makassar Strait, the first important surface action of
the war for the U.S. Navy. On 9 March 1942 formal surrender by the
Dutch ended all resistance in the Netherlands East Indies. By these
conquests in Asia and the Pacific, the Japanese gained valuable territory
rich in natural resources and were ready to expand in other directions.</p>

<p>During the first six months of 1942 the U.S. Navy fought the Japanese
Navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway,
and raided the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. Army Air Forces medium
bombers took off from a carrier at sea and bombed Tokyo in April
1942 in a surprise attack. As part of the Midway operations in June,
planes of the Japanese Navy bombed U.S. installations in Alaska and
enemy troops landed in the Aleutian Islands on Attu and Kiska.</p>

<p>The Allied defensive phase of the war in the Pacific ended on 6
August 1942, with the Allies ready to strike the enemy-held islands in
the South Pacific.</p>

and trained personnel, and not until February 1941 did troop reinforcements and
up-to-date equipment begin to arrive in Hawaii. The United States was not prepared for
war and the men and equipment did not meet the necessary requirements.</p>

<h2>The Strategic Defensive<br>
and Tactical Offensive<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h2>


<p>By August 1942 the Allies had established a series of defensive
island bases, along an arc reaching from Honolulu to Sydney, which
served as steppingstones for the supply system and the springboard for
later offensive operations. The Japanese threat to these islands in late
summer 1942 put the Allies on the tactical offensive, strategic defensive.
Rabaul, the principal Japanese base in the Southwest Pacific, became
the objective of a two-pronged Allied counterattack. One prong,
starting with Guadalcanal, was directed up the chain of Solomons; the
other prong, starting from Port Moresby, was directed through northeastern
New Guinea toward New Britain.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> See John Miller, jr., <i>Guadalcanal: The First Offensive</i>, Washington, D.C., 1949 and <i>Cartwheel: The
Reduction of Rabaul</i>, Washington, D.C. 1959; Samuel Milner, <i>Victory in Papua</i>, Washington, D.C., 1957; and
Philip A. Crowl and Edmund G. Love, <i>The Seizure of the Gilberts and Marshalls</i>, Washington, D.C., 1955, in
the series <i>U.S. ARMY IN WORLD WAR II.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The Guadalcanal Campaign, first in the Solomon ladder, was undertaken
with extremely limited means. Ground forces, aided by the
Navy and Air Forces, fought tenaciously, bringing the campaign to an
end on 21 February 1943, a little over six months after its inception.
Advancing further up the Solomon chain, the Allies made unopposed
landings in the Russells on 21 February. Construction of airstrips, a
radar station, a motor torpedo boat base, and facilities to accommodate
a large quantity of supplies was immediately undertaken there.</p>

<p>In preparation for the assault on the Munda airfield, New Georgia,
combat troops underwent rigorous training during the following
months. Before this assault, Rendova was occupied on 30 June against
only light opposition. This island provided gun positions and a staging
point for the thrust against Munda Point two days later. Munda airfield
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>was captured on 5 August and by the 25th all organized resistance
on New Georgia Island ceased. The next objective was Vella Lavella
where landings were made on the southern end of the island on 15 August
without opposition. Simultaneously, the lesser islands in the New
Georgia group were occupied and the enemy evacuated Vella Lavella
during the night of 6-7 October. The New Georgia group operation
was closed on 15 October.</p>

<p>On the night of 26-27 October 1943, New Zealand troops landed
on the Treasury Islands which were to be used as a staging area for
landing craft. On 28 October a U.S. Marine battalion executed diversionary
landings on Choiseul in preparation for a surprise attack at
Bougainville on 1 November. By the end of the year a naval base and
three airfields had become operational on Bougainville. No further
offensive action was undertaken by U.S. forces on the island since
the American troops expected to be replaced by Australian units. Naval
engagements and air attacks throughout this entire period effected
considerable damage on the enemy.</p>

<p>In the latter part of September 1942, nearly two months after the
invasion of Guadalcanal, the initial Allied blow of the second prong
was made in Papua. On 16 September the enemy advance in Papua
was halted at a point less than 20 miles from Port Moresby where
it was met by stiffened Australian resistance. American troops were
rushed into Port Moresby by plane and boat, and a counter-attack was
launched in the last days of September. The enemy fell back to Buna
and, while the Australian forces laboriously made their way over the
steep mountain trails, American troops were flown overland toward
Jaure. During this campaign U.S. troops in New Guinea learned the
bitter lessons of jungle warfare by actual experience. By 23 January
1943 organized resistance had been wiped out, ending the Papua
Campaign.</p>

<p>While the ground forces were fighting the enemy in Papua, U.S.
aircraft struck at his bases at Salamaua, Lae, Finschhafen, Madang,
and Wewak in Northeast New Guinea. In the latter part of January,
American troops followed by Australian troops, were flown over the
mountains to engage the enemy at threatened points along his advance
from his defense bases. Fighting over the rugged terrain in this area
was slow and costly. Salamaua was overrun on 12 September, and
when troops entered Lae on 16 September the enemy had fled into the
hills to the north. To prevent the Japanese from attempting further advances
between September and December, pressure was maintained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
by the Allies in a slow move toward Madang on the northeast coast of
New Guinea.</p>

<p>New moves to isolate Rabaul started on 15 December, when troops
landed on Arawe on the southern coast of New Britain, and on 26 December,
when landings were made on both sides of Cape Gloucester.
At the end of the year Rabaul was under constant air attack by U.S.
aircraft, and the enemy’s line of communication from Rabaul to the
Solomon-New Guinea area was severed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the plan of operation against the Japanese in the Aleutians
was to attack Attu in an attempt to compel them to evacuate Kiska.
Attu was invaded on 11 May 1943 and for eighteen days a bitter
and bloody fight ensued. The fighting ended on 30 May but mopping-up
operations continued for several days. When Kiska was invaded on
15 August the island was deserted; the Japanese had withdrawn.</p>

<p>While the enemy was fully occupied in the Southwest Pacific, an
invasion of the Gilbert Islands was made on the Makin and Tarawa
Atolls on 20 November. This was the first in a series of moves to recover
Japanese-held bases that could be used to further the Allied advance
toward the heart of the Japanese Empire. Only moderate opposition
was met at Makin and by evening of the 23d its capture was
complete. At Tarawa much stronger resistance was encountered but
was destroyed by the 24th, except for isolated groups which were later
eliminated. Other islands in both atolls were occupied during the following
days.</p>

<h2>The Offensive——1944<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h2>


<p>The battle of production and supply, designed to build a foundation
to support unprecedented Allied air and naval power, was won
during 1942 and 1943, while Japanese air and naval power greatly diminished.
Hawaii, the most important naval base in the Pacific, had
become a training center and staging area for U.S. troops as well as
one of the many important supply bases. In 1944, the strategic offensive
against Japan began.</p>

</div>

<p>Following the invasion of the Gilberts in late 1943, U.S. forces
prepared for an assault in the western Marshalls, the principal objective
being Kwajalein and Eniwetok Atolls. According to plans for the
assault on the western Marshalls, a Marine division was to seize the
northern half of the Kwajalein Atoll, principally the islands of Roi and
Namur; Army ground forces units were to capture the southern half
of the atoll, including the island of Kwajalein, and to occupy Majuro
Island, one of the finest naval anchorages west of Pearl Harbor. Supporting
naval and air bombardment and artillery fire (the artillery had
been ferried ashore on the small nearby islands) were brought to bear
on the selected landing beaches of Kwajalein and Roi Islands of Kwajalein
Atoll. Unopposed landings were made on both islands on 1 February
1944, with slight resistance developing after advance was made
inland. Six days after the main landings, all the islands of the Kwajalein
Atoll were in U.S. hands and Majuro had been occupied. On 17
February landings were made on the islands of Eniwetok Atoll; resistance
was wiped out five days later. A two-day strike against Truk, 16
and 17 February, was executed by a large carrier task force to screen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>the assault of the Eniwetok Atoll and to test strength of the Japanese
base there.</p>

<p>Although the strong enemy island bases in the eastern Marshalls
were bypassed, the air forces maintained continual attacks on them
throughout the year. Conquest of the western Marshalls provided air
bases and a new forward fleet base in the Pacific.</p>

<p>The Mariana Islands, the next objective in the Central Pacific, differ
from the coral atolls of the Marshalls and Gilberts. The individual
islands are much larger and the distinguishing terrain features
are precipitous coast lines, high hills, and deep ravines. Plans were
made, ships and supplies collected, and the troops given special training
for the invasion; meanwhile Japanese air and ground reinforcements
poured into the Central Pacific.</p>

<p>An intense air offensive against enemy installations in the Marianas
began on 11 June 1944 and a naval bombardment of Saipan began
on the 13th, two days before the landings on the 15th. Opposition was
heavy at first, but by the 25th U.S. troops, supported by tanks, heavy
artillery, renewed naval gunfire, and aerial bombardment, drove the
enemy from the high ground on the central part of the island. Again
advances were slow and difficult with heavy troop losses. On 9 July
the mission was completed, except for mopping-up operations which
continued for nearly two months.</p>

<p>On the morning of 24 July an attack was made on Tinian, supported
by artillery on Saipan. Enemy resistance, slight for first two days,
increased when high ground was reached in the central part of the island.
The entire island was overrun by 1 August.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Guam had been invaded on 21 July by U.S. forces
in two separate landings. This invasion was preceded by a thirteen-day
aerial and naval softening-up process. The two beachheads were
joined after three days of fighting. The troops, greatly hampered by
heavy undergrowth, concentrated on the high ground in the northern
part of the island and, except for resistance from small groups
of scattered Japanese, were in command of the island by 10 August.</p>

<p>A force of nearly 800 ships from the Guadalcanal area sailed for the
Palau Islands, the next hop in the Central Pacific. Marines landed on
Peleliu Island on 15 September while Army units landed on Angaur on
the 17th. These were the two southernmost islands of the Palau group.
Opposition on Angaur was relatively light. Much stiffer resistance was
met on Peleliu, which contained the site of the major Japanese airfield
on the islands. The troops succeeded, by 12 October, in pushing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
enemy into a small area in the central hills of Peleliu, but many more
weeks were spent destroying the remaining opposition.</p>

<p>During the fighting in the southern Palaus, Ulithi Atoll in the western
Carolines was taken to secure a naval anchorage in the western
Pacific. Air attack against bypassed islands was maintained. Meanwhile,
huge air bases were being developed in the Marianas for use by
B-29 bombers. On 24 November B-29’s operating from Saipan made
the first of a series of attacks on Tokyo.</p>

<p>Concurrent with the operations in the Marshalls, Marianas, Palaus,
and Carolines, forces of the Southwest Pacific Area moved
swiftly along the northern coast of New Guinea, jumped to Vogelkop
Peninsula, and then to Morotai and on into the Philippines. The first
amphibious advance of 1944 in this area was made on 2 January at
Saidor, to capture the airport there. The next major advance was begun
early on the morning of 29 February when a landing was effected
on Los Negros in the Admiralty Islands. The Japanese sent reinforcements
from Manus Island, separated from Los Negros by only 100
yards of water. Except for isolated groups of enemy troops, Los Negros
was cleared on the 23d and Momote airfield, on the east coast,
was ready for operation. Manus Island was invaded on 15 March, after
the seizure of a few smaller islands, and an airfield there was captured
the next day. At the end of April most of the enemy had been cleared
from the Admiralties.</p>

<p>In New Britain the beachheads established in 1943 were expanded.
On 6 March another landing took place on Willaumez Peninsula
on the north coast. This operation, together with the establishment of
airfields in the Admiralties and the occupation of Green and Emirau
Islands, completed the encirclement and neutralization of Rabaul, the
once powerful Japanese base. On 26 November U.S. units left New
Britain, the enemy being contained on the Gazelle Peninsula by the
Australians.</p>

<p>In New Guinea, after the Saidor operation, the enemy organized
his defenses in the coastal area between Wewak and Madang. Surprise
landings by U.S. troops were made at Aitape and Hollandia, both west
of Wewak, on 22 April. Within five days the airfields at Hollandia and
Aitape were in Allied possession. In July 1944 the Japanese Army, which
had moved up the coast from Wewak, attacked the Allied perimeter
at Aitape. Within a month the Japanese had been thrown back toward
Wewak. At the end of the year Australian troops, which had begun
relieving U.S. forces at Aitape in October, started a drive on Wewak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
from the west. While the enemy was bottled up in this area, the Allies
continued to leap-frog up the New Guinea coast.</p>

<p>On 17 May forces debarked at Arare, 125 miles northwest of Hollandia,
and established a strong beachhead. Wakdé Island, just offshore,
was assaulted the next day and was secured by the 19th.</p>

<p>Other units assaulted the island of Biak on 27 May to seize additional
air base sites. Here considerable resistance was met and the
island with its airfields was not secured until August. Noemfoor Island,
where three airfields were located, was invaded on 2 July by
troops which landed at points where reefs made invasion hazardous.
The Noemfoor airstrips were captured by night of the 6th. The last
landing on New Guinea was an unopposed one made on 30 July in
the Cape Sansapor area, on the northwestern coast of the Vogelkop
Peninsula. The Japanese in New Guinea had been eliminated from
the war.</p>

<p>Another air base site on the southern tip of Morotai Island,
northwest of the Vogelkop Peninsula, was seized on 15 September
at slight cost. The invasion of Morotai, lying between New Guinea
and the Philippines, was the last major operation undertaken by
Southwest Pacific forces before the attack on the Philippines in
October.</p>

<p>Prior to the invasion of the Philippines a seven-day air attack, beginning
on 10 October, was undertaken against enemy bases on the
Ryukyu Islands, Formosa, and Luzon. On 17 October, Suluan, Homonhon,
and Dinagat Islands, guarding Leyte Gulf where the main
invasion was to be made, were captured.</p>

<p>Despite all this activity, strategic surprise proved complete when,
on 20 October 1944, the assault forces landed on Leyte. Heavy opposition
was encountered on only one of the many beaches. Throughout
the entire campaign, opposition at times was fierce although
it came from relatively small units or from separate defense positions.
Between 23 and 26 October the naval battle for Leyte Gulf
took place. The enemy made every effort to hold Leyte; reinforcements
were rushed in by every means available to them and during
November an all-out struggle for Leyte developed. Bad weather
conditions in November seriously interfered with the supply of U.S.
forces and with air operations. On 7 December U.S. troops landed
on the west coast of Leyte at Ormoc to place new strength at the rear
of Japanese forces holding out in northwestern Leyte and to prevent
the Japanese from landing any more reinforcements in the Ormoc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
area. By 26 December Leyte was declared secured but mopping up
against strong resistance continued for several months.</p>

<h2>The Final Phase<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h2>


<p>The last three months of 1944 marked the almost complete destruction
of Japanese air power in the Philippines and the defeat of the
enemy ground forces on Leyte. In January 1945 men and equipment
began to arrive in the Pacific in ever increasing numbers. Sixth and
Eighth Armies were fighting the Japanese in the Philippines, while the
Tenth was being organized to be used later on Okinawa. The Navy and
Air Forces were also expanding in number of men, ships, and planes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> See Roy E. Appleman, James M. Burns, Russell A. Gugeler, and John Stevens, <i>Okinawa: The Last
Battle</i>. Washington D.C. 1948, in the series <i>U.S. ARMY IN WORLD WAR II.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The next step in the reconquest of the Philippines was the battle
for Luzon. Mindoro was seized before the invasion of Luzon was
launched so that an Allied air base could be established to provide air
support for the ground operations on Luzon. On 9 January 1945 U.S.
troops landed on the beaches of Lingayen Gulf on the western side of
Luzon. The landings were virtually unopposed and assault troops advanced
rapidly inland until they came to rugged terrain and well-prepared
Japanese defense. While part of the forces were left to hold a
line facing north, the bulk of the troops turned south toward Manila,
which was captured. Bataan Peninsula was cleared of enemy troops
and Corregidor was seized. While the U.S. attack carried on to clear
the southern portion of the island, another advance through the difficult
mountainous terrain in the north got under way. This was the climax
to the fighting on Luzon.</p>

<p>While the battle for Luzon was in progress, other U.S. troops were
clearing the enemy pockets on Leyte and Samar and capturing the islands
in the southern Philippines with a speed and thoroughness which
showed the high degree of coordination developed by the ground, sea,
and air forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span></p>

<p>By the time the fighting stopped on Luzon, U.S. troops were being
redeployed from Europe to the Pacific, and in July the first contingent
of service troops from the ETO arrived in Manila. In August the U.S.
First Army established its command post on Luzon.</p>

<p>On 19 February 1945 Iwo Jima in the Bonin Islands was assaulted
by marines who, by 16 March, overcame the stubborn enemy resistance
and secured the island for an advance air base from which the
U.S. Air Forces could support the invasion of Japan. On 1 April the
invasion of Okinawa in the Ryukyus began. This island, assaulted by
Marine and Army troops, was the last in the island-hopping warfare—in
fact the last of the battles before the fall of Japan itself. As on Iwo,
the enemy had prepared elaborate defenses and fought fanatically in
the unsuccessful attempt to prevent the U.S. forces from seizing the
island. Because of its closeness to Japan, the enemy was able to attack
Okinawa by air from its home bases and air superiority had not
been gained by the Allies before the amphibious assault began. This
period of fighting was marked by Japanese suicide attacks against Allied
naval ships and the Navy sustained heavy losses, losses greater
than in any other campaign during the war. On 21 June the island was
declared secure and the next few days were spent mopping up enemy
pockets. The fall of Okinawa and Iwo gave the Allies the air bases
from which the almost daily aerial attacks on the principal industrial
cities of Japan were to be launched, as well as emergency landing
fields for crippled B-29’s returning to their more distant island bases
from attacks on Japan.</p>

<h2>China-Burma-India<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></h2>


<p>China’s last important supply link with the Allies, the Burma Road,
was closed when the Japanese occupied northern Burma in May 1942.
Despite her isolation, China resisted the Japanese and remained an
active ally. The importance of giving China sufficient support to keep
her in the war led to the Allied plan to re-establish surface communications
with China and to increase supply by air over the Hump.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> See Charles F. Romanus and Riley Sunderland, <i>Stilwell’s Mission to China</i>, Washington, D.C., 1953;
and Romanus and Sunderland, <i>Stilwell’s Command Problems</i>, Washington, D.C., 1956, in the series <i>U.S.
ARMY IN WORLD WAR II.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In August 1942 a training center was established at Ramgarh, India,
for training the poorly equipped Chinese troops; concurrently,
training centers were also established in China. In December 1942
the Allies began the construction of a new road leading from Ledo,
India, across northern Burma to an intersection with the Burma Road
near the China border. Subsequently this was supplemented by a pipeline
for aviation and fuel oil from Calcutta, India, to Kunming, China.
Pending the reopening of ground communications with China, the
only route of supply available was the air transport system over the
spur of the Himalayas from the Assam valley, India, to Kunming, a
distance of approximately 500 air miles.</p>

<p>Fighting in Burma was relatively light in 1943; however, Allied
aircraft pounded enemy airfields, communications, and rear installations.
Rangoon, important center of the enemy supply system, was
bombed repeatedly with damaging results.</p>

<p>In China during 1943, air attacks constituted the only offensive
operations by the Allies. U.S. planes carried out attacks against enemy
bases in Burma, Thailand, Indo-China, Hainan, Hong Kong, and
Formosa. Shipping along the China coast was attacked with little loss
to the enemy. In 1944 B-29’s based in China attacked targets in Manchuria,
on Formosa, and in Japan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span></p>

<p>During this time the Japanese had increased their China-based air
strength but were deploying their best planes and pilots to meet the
threat in the Southwest Pacific.</p>

<p>The Allied counteroffensive in north Burma, which started early in
1944, continued to the end of the year with great intensity. Landings in
the Philippines and U.S. naval operations in the China Sea threatened
the Japanese supply line to Burma and by the end of January 1945,
large groups of enemy forces were retreating from north Burma. As a
result of the Allied advance in Burma in 1944, the entire route of the
new Ledo Road was cleared except for a small stretch near its junction
with the Burma Road. On 4 February the first Allied convoy traveled
over the Ledo Road, which was renamed the Stilwell Highway.</p>

<p>In the latter stages of the Burma Campaign, American troops together
with Chinese troops were flown to China. Serious Japanese offensives
in China during the summer of 1944 and early 1945 were terminated
in the spring of 1945 and the enemy began to withdraw from
south and central China.</p>

</div>

<p class="c">SECTION VI</p>


<h2>The Collapse of Japan and the<br>
End of the War in the Pacific</h2>


<p>The capture of Iwo Jima gave the Allies bases for fighter planes
which were to escort the Superfortresses, based in the Marianas, when
they attacked Japan. With Okinawa in U.S. hands other bombers could
join the B-29’s in the raids. The first Superfortresses flying from the
Marianas struck Tokyo in November 1944. The number of planes used
in the attacks increased with each raid until, in July 1945, over 40,000
tons of bombs were dropped on Japan. During July most of the industrial
areas of Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kobe, and Osaka had been
destroyed. The Air Forces then turned its attention to secondary targets
and to mining operations planned to blockade Japan so that her
warships would be unable to leave the harbors and her ships carrying
supplies would be unable to enter Japanese waters.</p>

<p>In July the U.S. Third Fleet was sent into Japanese waters to assist
in preventing the Japanese fleet from leaving its bases and to shell enemy
installations along the coast. Aircraft from naval carriers joined
in the attack and the combined efforts of the Allied air power reduced
Japan’s air force to scattered remnants.</p>

<p>The Allies issued the Potsdam Proclamation on 26 July 1945 calling
upon the Japanese to surrender unconditionally. Japan refused the
terms and the Allies began a new series of attacks. On 6 August the
first atomic bomb to be used against an enemy was dropped on Hiroshima;
on 8 August, the Russians declared war on Japan; and on 9 August
a second atomic bomb was released, this time over the city of Nagasaki.
These blows were closely followed by a series of Allied aerial
attacks and on 15 August Japan accepted the Potsdam terms, ending
the war in the Pacific.</p>

<p>On 2 September 1945 the Supreme Commander for the Allied
Powers accepted the formal Japanese surrender aboard the battleship
USS <i>Missouri</i> in a twenty-minute ceremony.</p>

to over forty thousand tons dropped in July 1945. More and more bombers were sent
against Japan with less fighter opposition until, by the end of July, the targets were announced

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
